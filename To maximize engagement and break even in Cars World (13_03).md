To prioritize magical moment tasks for the Cars World Showroom with AI bots operating autonomously in Unity, leverage the March 12, 2025, data for strategic scheduling as of March 13, 2025:

* **Regular Scheduling**: Trigger magical moments (e.g., AI bots showcasing and Test Driving cars with glowing effects) every 20-30 minutes throughout the day. This ensures a lively showroom, even during low-login periods like 07:00 (0 logins, 8 calls), keeping it immersive for potential visitors.  
* **Peak Hour Boost**: Increase frequency to every 15-20 minutes during high-call times—06:00 (53 calls), 10:00 (81 calls), 17:00 (66 calls), and 20:00 (114 calls)—to enhance engagement when users (4 total logins) are more active.  
* **Diversity and Optimization**: Implement varied, lightweight moments (e.g., virtual test drives, interactive displays) to maintain freshness and ensure smooth performance in Unity.

This approach keeps the AI-driven showroom enchanting and engaging, regardless of user presence, balancing activity with system efficiency.
